    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
      55fgsys is a hybrid digital government platform that protects citizens from scams, unfair treatment, and opaque AI systems by embedding Digital Judge as a transparent, rights-respecting governance assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first flagship workflow is <strong>Anti-Scam Tunnel v1</strong>, a people-facing digital justice tunnel that lets users report fintech and mobile money scams, triggers AI risk analysis, and coordinates fast, accountable action with providers and authorities.

    <h2>Anti-Scam Tunnel v1</h2>
    <p><strong>Scope:</strong> First prototype for Tanzania mobile money users and fintech scams.</p>

    <h3>Step 1 – Start complaint</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>User clicks <strong>“Report fintech scam”</strong> in 55fgsys.</li>
      <li>User selects scam type (fake investment, unauthorized debit, phishing, identity theft, etc.).</li>
      <li>User provides core details: app/platform name, dates, amount, whether money is still moving or already gone.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 2 – Upload evidence</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>User uploads screenshots, chat logs, SMS messages, transaction IDs, and any receipts or contracts.</li>
      <li>Digital Judge prompts: “Show first contact”, “Show payment proof”, “Show any promises or terms”.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3 – Automatic risk &amp; pattern check</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Digital Judge analyzes transactions, behaviour, and known scam patterns to assign a <strong>risk score</strong> (low / medium / high).</li>
      <li>High-risk cases can trigger automatic alerts or temporary blocks through partner APIs (banks, mobile money, fintechs) where integrated.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4 – Notify parties &amp; protect victim</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Victim receives an instant protection guide: security steps, who to contact, and what to monitor.</li>
      <li>Relevant providers (bank, mobile operator, app) receive a structured complaint package with a response deadline.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5 – Digital Judge + human review</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Digital Judge prepares a case summary: timeline, risk score, key evidence, and applicable rules.</li>
      <li>A human panel (regulator, consumer protection, or community council) reviews, may hold an online session, and issues a decision.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 6 – Resolution, appeal, and learning</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>User receives a clear decision, remedy (for example, refund or account block), and explanation.</li>
      <li>User can appeal; appeals are routed to a higher-level review process.</li>
      <li>Confirmed scams update the shared risk database so future cases are detected earlier and handled faster.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Status &amp; Next Moves</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This document acts as a live design draft for 55fgsys, Digital Judge, and Anti-Scam Tunnel v1.</li>
      <li>Next moves: wireframe the screens, define data models (cases, evidence, risk scores), and integrate with at least one Tanzanian provider for a pilot.</li>
